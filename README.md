# project_layout_black
test / exercise for Deloitte.

#Technologies used:

* Flexbox: for the layout, to avoid using 3rd party grid systems.

* html5: using semantic tags, that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation.

* css3: Using when needed the BEM approach (block element modifier) to keep the class names meaningful and easier to organize.

* Javascript: ES2015 to handle the UI events triggered by the user

* Mobile first approach: the classes are FIRST defined for MOBILE devices, and then added media queries to define the classes for desktop resolutions.

* Media queries for responsive features.

~~~~~~~~
* Note for Designer: This is a test, and I know it needs more fine tuning to get the exact styles
from the high level def mockup.
